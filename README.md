I created this simple program to help a lecturer organize his MP3 recordings before publication on a flash drive.

The files are numbered with the format 123. <Lecture Name>. This program allows easy reordering. When dragging and dropping a filename it will rename it with the correct new number.

To begin, click Select Folder and select the folder containing the files.

Right click and click Rename to directly rename a file. Click Save to save the new names.
